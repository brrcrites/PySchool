# Problem Solving in Python

This is a collection of open source materials originally used to assist high school teachers with bringing the python programming language into the classroom. It was developed so that it could be used for either distance learning or as in-classroom material and contains step by step explinations of the theorhetical and practical principles one might need to begin their programming journey. Many of the examples it includes are based on principles from physics and chemistry in order to reinforce those scientific concepts and show how programming can be used to solve real problems.

This respository contains all the coding examples and solutions to challenge problems that are referenced in the slides, which can be found [here on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wMjzkeeOl5Zd3jxO2RZUAoKPvrYlVFqOJkeDXqWHWrw/edit?usp=sharing)
