# Problem Solving in Python

Welcome to the material for Problem Solving in Python. This is a set of open source material intended to help high school teachers with brining the python programming language into the classroom. It contains step by step explinations of all the theorhetical and practical principles someone would need to start their journey into programming, as well as examples of these concepts based on principles of physics and chemistry to both reinforce those concepts as well as show how programming can be used to solve real problems, making it truely cross-cutting curriculum ready for the next generation science standards.

The slides that accompany these code examples can be found [here on Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wMjzkeeOl5Zd3jxO2RZUAoKPvrYlVFqOJkeDXqWHWrw/edit?usp=sharing)
